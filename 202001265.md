<h3><b>Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:</b></h3>

<ul>
 
<li><b><h4> Functional Requirements: </h4></b></li>
  <ol>
    <li><b>User authentication and authorization:</b><br> This requirement involves creating a system for users to log in to access library services, and for the library to verify the user's identity and determine the level of access the user has to the system's features.</li>
   <li><b>Search and retrieval of information:</b><br> This requirement involves creating a search engine that allows users to find resources in the library based on keywords, author, title, or other criteria.</li>
   <li><b>Check-in/check-out and renewals of books:</b><br> This requirement involves creating a system for users to check out books, as well as a system for tracking the books they have checked out, the due date, and the option to renew books if they are not yet overdue.</li>
   <li><b>Notifications for overdue books and reserved materials:</b><br> This requirement involves creating a system for sending notifications to users regarding overdue books or books that have been reserved by another user.</li>
   <li><b>User's borrowing history:</b><br> This requirement involves creating a system for users to view their borrowing history, including books they have checked out, returned, or renewed.</li>
   <li><b>Reporting and data analysis:</b><br> This requirement involves creating a system for generating reports on library usage, including circulation statistics, and for analyzing data to help improve library services.</li>
   <li><b>User feedback and suggestions:</b><br> This requirement involves creating a system for users to provide feedback and suggestions for improving library services.</li>
</ol>
  
<li><b><h4> Non Functional Requirements:</h4></b> </li>
  <ol>
   <li><b>User-friendly interface: </b><br>This requirement involves creating a system that is easy for users to understand and use, with clear navigation and an intuitive layout.</li>
   <li><b>High availability and reliability:</b><br> This requirement involves ensuring that the library information system is always available and reliable, with minimal downtime and system errors.</li>
   <li><b>Scalability to accommodate future growth: </b><br>This requirement involves ensuring that the system can grow and expand as the library's needs change, without requiring significant modifications or upgrades.</li>
   <li><b>Data security and privacy: </b><br>This requirement involves ensuring that user data is secure and protected from unauthorized access, theft, or other forms of exploitation.</li>
   <li><b>Accessibility and compatibility with various devices and platforms: </b><br>This requirement involves ensuring that the library information system is accessible from a variety of devices and platforms, and that it is compatible with a range of operating systems, web browsers, and screen sizes.</li>
   <li><b>Compliance with industry standards and regulations: </b><br>This requirement involves ensuring that the library information system complies with industry standards and regulations, such as data privacy laws.</li>
   <li><b>Cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance:</b><br> This requirement involves creating a system that is cost-effective and easy to maintain, with minimal costs for updates</li>
</ol>
  
</ul>

<h3><b>Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.</b></h3>

<ul>
 <li><b>Scope : </b><br> To create a mobile application to help people with hearing loss.</li>
 <li><b>Features :</b>
   <ol>
    <li>Artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events (e.g. car horns and babies)</li>
    <li>Immediate alerts for the recognized sounds</li>
    <li>Continual logging of the recognized sounds</li>
    <li>Optimized for Android devices with low-latency for real-time use.</li>
  </ol>
